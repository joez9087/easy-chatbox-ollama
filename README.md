# chatbox-ollama

I've created a simple web-based chatbox using Ollama, which allows for image and text input. However, since it's running locally, the response time might be a bit longer.
You need to download the Ollama server first, and when running it, remember to first pull the 'llama3.1'and 'llava' models to your local environment.
